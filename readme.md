# ranked killfeed
ranked_killfeed.js shows the weapon of the enemy who has just died (AK dead, SMG dead, SNIPER dead, …)

## Different settings:
`rankedOrComp_only`: if you want the popups only for competitive/ranked matches, or also for pubs games (works only for team mode, not FFA)

`weapon_only`: displays only the weapon, without “dead”

`color_feed`: the text color (the same as the score popup color by default)
